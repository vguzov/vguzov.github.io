I am a PhD student at the <a href='https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de'>Real Virtual Humans group</a> within the Department of Computer Science at the University of Tübingen 
and the department of Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, under supervision of Prof. Dr. Gerard Pons-Moll.

I have done my Bachelor and Master research in the field of human reconstruction from depth images at Moscow State University Graphics and Media Lab. 

My research is focused on human motion and human-object interaction capturing from wearable sensors, as well as human motion generation.
